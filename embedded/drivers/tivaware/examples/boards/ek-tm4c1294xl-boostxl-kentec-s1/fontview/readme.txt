Font Viewer

This example displays the contents of a TivaWare Graphics Library font
on the board's LCD touchscreen.  By default, the application shows a test
font containing ASCII, the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana alphabets,
and a group of Korean Hangul characters.

The LCD BoosterPack (BOOSTXL-K350QVG-S1) should be installed on
BoosterPack 2 interface headers.
