CC3100 HTTP Server Example

This application demonstrates web-based I/O control using CC3100
Boosterpack (on Boosterpack 2 header) and EK-TM4C1294XL, which allows the
end-users to communicate and control with EK-TM4C1294XL using standard
web-browsers.

The CC3100 acts as an Access Point and uses the SSID <app_mode_SSID> that
can be modified statically by updating the value of the define SSID_AP_MODE
in the file sl_common.h.

The information and debug messages are transmitted over UART0, which can be
accessed with a terminal window at 115200 baud with the settings 8-N-1.

This application is built with Webpages, that can be uploaded to the serial
flash on CC3100 Boosterpack by pressing and holding USR_SW1 during reset.
These webpages take preference over the default ones that come with the
CC3100 BoosterPack.

Once a WIFI station connects to CC3100, domain name and authorization
parameters are displayed on the terminal window.  Use the domain name on a
standard browser to access the webserver and enter authorization details
when prompted.

The I/O control can be achieved via the webpage ``IO Control Demo'', which
uses JavaScript running in the web browser to send HTTP requests to control
the Animation LED (LED D1) and the Toggle LED (LED D2).  Responses
generated by the board are returned to the browser and inserted into the
page's HTML dynamically by more JavaScript code.

Source files for the internal file system image can be found in the ``fs''
directory.  If any of these files are changed, the file system image
(cc3100_fsdata.h) should be rebuilt by running the following command from
the project root directory:

../../../../tools/bin/makefsfile -i fs -o cc3100_fsdata.h -r -h -q
