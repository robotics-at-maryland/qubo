Temperature Measurement with the TMP006

This example demonstrates the basic use of the Sensor Library, TM4C123G
LaunchPad and the SensHub BoosterPack to obtain ambient and object
temperature measurements with the Texas Instruments TMP006 sensor.

Connect a serial terminal program to the LaunchPad's ICDI virtual serial
port at 115,200 baud.  Use eight bits per byte, no parity and one stop bit.
The raw sensor measurements are printed to the terminal.  The RGB LED
blinks at 1Hz once the initialization is complete and the example is
running.
